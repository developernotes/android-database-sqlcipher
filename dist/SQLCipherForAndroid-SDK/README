HOW TO

1) Update your import path from android.database to info.guardianproject.database and you are almost there!

2) then when you open your database, just pass a variable argument to the open database method with your password:
	
	SQLiteDatabase.loadLibs(this); //first init the db libraries with the context
	SQLiteOpenHelper.getWritableDatabase("thisismysecret"):

and you are secured!

You will need to implement some sort of PIN or password entry user interface to your application, as well.
